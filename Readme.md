# Viscek model simulation in 3D

The Vicsek model simulates the collective behavior of particles in space, where each particle moves with a constant speed and interacts with its neighbors within a specified radius, leading to emergent swarming patterns. The simulation captures the dynamics of self-propelling agents influenced by random fluctuations in direction, demonstrates the complex behaviors characteristic of active matter systems.
